#This SQL project will be where I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to compute statistics, and develop more knowledge regarding the presented customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those were iPhone for orders? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all of the orders placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which was the cheapest product sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in(SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101 and how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity), product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. What was the amount of customers that ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(cust.acctnum), avg(quantity)*price 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
